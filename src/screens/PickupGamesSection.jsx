                Pick-up games are friendly, one-off football matches open to players of all skill levels. You're welcome to join on your own, with friends, or even with your entire team â€” whatever suits you best. We offer different types of games, such as 5-a-side and 7-a-side, as well as options like women's, mixed-gender, and advanced matches.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-base text-primary-black mb-4">
                Simply register through the app, select your preferred game, and arrive ready to play. Each match is managed by a Vaya organizer, who may adjust teams to help ensure a fair and enjoyable experience for everyone.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-base text-primary-black mb-4">
                The games are casual and flexible, making it easy to fit football into your schedule. All players are welcome, regardless of experience.
